Béton3 is an open-source macropad design based around the QMK-compatible Pro Micro platform, MX-mount keyswitches and a commonly available, clickable rotary encoder design.

The defining feature of Béton3 is the cast concrete rotary encoder knob, created using a 3D printed mold that results in a distinct, weighty knob with luxurious inertia and precise steps, much like a premium stereo system.

Below the rotary encoder, a 0.91" OLED screen is a bright, programmable canvas for information, text or animations.  Using the Béton3 stock firmware, fluid animations quickly respond to button and knob inputs with icons representing media control and volume control actions.
