# Béton3
# 3D-printed Concrete Knob Mold

The 3D files in this folder combine to create a concrete mold for Béton3's rotary encoder knob.

Files:

- moldside.ipt - Original Autodesk Inventor file
- **moldside.stl** - 180 degrees of the concrete mold's side.

- moldbase.ipt - Original Autodesk Inventor file
- **moldside.stl** - Concrete mold's base.

In order to create a functioning mold, you'll need to print 2 of the moldside file, and 1 of the moldbase file.

For more information on using the resultant mold, consult the [Build Guide.](https://github.com/adamlechowicz/Beton3/tree/master/Build%20Guide)
