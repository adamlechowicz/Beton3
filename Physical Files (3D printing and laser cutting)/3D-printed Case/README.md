# Béton3
# 3D-printed Case

Files:

- betonbase.ipt - Original Autodesk Inventor file
- **betonbase.stl** - The primary structural base for Béton3.  File uses millimeters for units.

- betonbottom.ipt - Original Autodesk Inventor file
- **betonbottom.stl** - Bottom sliding cover for Béton3.  File uses millimeters for units.

The STL files can be directly uploaded to a 3D-printing service for printing.  In my initial build, I used [Sculpteo](https://www.sculpteo.com/en/) for printing, and chose (Multijet Fusion, Not Dyed, Grey) plastic.  Not only is this plastic the cheapest option on many 3D-printing sites, the Multijet Fusion process creates a unique rough finish that hides layers and blends with the "concrete" aesthetic of Béton3, while striking a great balance between elasticity and rigidity.

As I don't personally have one, I have not tried printing these files with a desktop printer such as a MakerBot.  Some part geometry may have to be modified for a satisfactory result on a "traditional" FDM printer.
