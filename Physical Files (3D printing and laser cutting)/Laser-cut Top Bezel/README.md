# Béton3
# Laser-cut Top Bezel

Files:
- **topbezel.ai** - An Adobe Illustrator file to use with a laser cutting service such as [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/), in order to create the top bezel for Béton3.

This file can be directly uploaded to Ponoko for laser-cutting.  For best results, the thickness of the top bezel should be between 0.24 and 0.26 inches.

For the material, anything wood or wood-adjacent (plywood, particleboard) should work, as long as you can use screws to attach the top bezel to the 3D-printed case.  I have not tested other types of materials such as acrylic, although they should theoretically work, assuming you can attach the resulting product to the bottom case.

For more information on the top bezel, consult the [Build Guide.](https://github.com/adamlechowicz/Beton3/tree/master/Build%20Guide)
